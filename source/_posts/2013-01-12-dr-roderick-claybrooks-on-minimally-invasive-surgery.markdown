Minimally invasive surgery is an advanced technique whereby the surgeon makes fewer and smaller incisions in the patient's body. A minimally invasive incision might be 20mm (less than one inch) in size.

When the incision is smaller the patient benefits in many ways, including:

* Less blood loss
* Shorter hospital stays
* Quicker recovery time
* Less anesthesia

In summary, minimally invasive surgery enables patients to recover faster. To learn more, consult your physician.
