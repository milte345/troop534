Members of Explorer Post 2534 are building projects based on the <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> microcontroller. What is Arduino? Several Arduino-based projects are shown in this 15-minute video:

After being introduced to the Arduino, each member of the Post was given some time to research possible projects for the device. One by one they stood before their peers to describe their ideas.

Massimo Banzi, co-founder of the Arduino Project, says it best: "If you have an idea, just go and make it. You don't need anybody's permission to create something great."
