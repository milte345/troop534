Eleven new Eagle Scouts were recognized on Sunday, Feb 13, 2011. The honorees are members of Troop 534, an organization that has produced 72 Eagles since 1938.

###Eagle Scouts: An Elite Group
Fewer than three percent (3%) of those who enter Scouting make it to the rank of Eagle. Scouts who earn the rank have learned skills such as wilderness survival, first aid, entrepreneurship, citizenship, and investing. Leadership skills are tested when the Eagle candidate assembles a team of fellow scouts to complete a service project. 

###Teamwork & Positive Results
Troop 534 is led by Scoutmaster Eddie L. Banks, Sr. and a dedicated group of adult volunteers. [St. Mark United Methodist Church](http://stmarkumcchicago.org) has provided meeting space and valuable support for over 70 years.

Thank you ABC 7 Chicago for coming out to cover the ceremony.

Our society grows stronger when we give our youth positive life experiences. Everybody wins when that happens. Congratulations Eagles!
