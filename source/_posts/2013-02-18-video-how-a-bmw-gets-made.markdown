The video was shared by Edward Hightower, Founder and Managing Director of [Motoring Ventures](http://motoringventures.com/). Hightower earned the rank of Eagle in Troop 534 "Hey!" in 1979. He holds a B. S. in General Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and an MBA from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.

Mr. Hightower visits Chicago from time to time. Scouts who plan to pursue a career in the automotive industry should make it a point to meet him.
