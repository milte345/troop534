The first and second practice hikes went well for our troop. We have two more practice hikes before the Lincoln Trail:

* Sat, April 13, 2013 at 8am (11.0 miles, turnaround at Navy Pier)
* Sat, April 20, 2013 at 8am (6.6 miles, turnaround at Shedd Aquarium)

Every hike starts at 39th Street and Lake Shore Drive. We begin stretching promptly at 8am, and we start hiking immeditely after that.

See you there!
