Some have wondered why Troop 534 is so steeped in tradition. Our reasons are well articulated by this sign at the University of Michigan's Crisler Arena in Ann Arbor, MI.

> Tradition is 
> our strength, forged over
> decades of self-sacrifice,
> of commitment to others
> and a greater cause.
> 
> Tradition is
> our accumulated experience.
> 
> Tradition is
> success and failure
> and how we handle both.
> It is time tested values
> and morals and ethics
> that define us.
> 
> Tradition is
> who we are and
> what we stand for.
> 
> Tradition is
> our future's foundation.

Well said, University of Michigan. And thank you Edward T. Hightower (Troop 534 Eagle in 1979, Michigan MBA in 1995) for sharing this quote.
